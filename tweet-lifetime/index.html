<h2 id="-why-"><em>Why?</em></h2>
<p>It&#39;s become apparent that social media content should <em>not</em> be permanent. At best, old content is of little value to its creator. At worst it&#39;s a liability, aggregated by marketers and cited by critics.</p>
<p>But social media does have value in the short-term. Services like Twitter are great for making announcements and having discussions. Tweet Lifetime is an attempt to keep Twitter relevant by retaining its short-term value and limiting its long-term liability.</p>
