# [*Tweet Lifetime*][tweet-lifetime] is a self-hosted service that continuously monitors your Twitter account and deletes old tweets.

## *Why?*

It's become apparent that social media content should *not* be permanent. At best, old content is of little value to its creator. At worst it's a liability, aggregated by marketers and cited by critics.

But social media does have value in the short-term. Services like Twitter are great for making announcements and having discussions. Tweet Lifetime is an attempt to keep Twitter relevant by retaining its short-term value and limiting its long-term liability.
